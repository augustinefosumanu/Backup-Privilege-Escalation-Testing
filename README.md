# Backup Privilege Escalation Testing

<h2> Lab </h2>

In this lab, I acted as a penetration tester tasked with identifying vulnerabilities in a target system's backup procedures. Key activities included:<br/>

-  <b>Privilege Escalation Testing</b>: Used the wildpwn.py tool to verify whether the system was vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks within its backup configuration.<br/>
-  <b>Vulnerability Assessment</b>: Analyzed the systemâ€™s current configuration to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for unauthorized access or control.<br/>

<h2> Step 1: Login as User Jane and verifying Sudo Rights for User jane </h2>
I first logged in as Jane using the <b>su 'User'</b> command, then verified that I had successfully switched users with the <b>whoami</b> command. Additionally, using the <b>sudo -l</b> command, I confirmed that Jane had no sudo privileges, which was essential for testing the exploitation process.

<h2> Step 2: Searching for tar file  </h2>
To search for tar files within the current user's directories, I used the <b>cd</b> command to navigate into the Documents directory. After that, I ran the <b>ls</b> command to list the contents, which revealed the presence of the tar file. <br />

<h2> Step 3: Verifying Ownership of the Tar File  </h2>
To test the wildcard attack, I first checked the ownership of the tar file in the Documents directory to confirm it didn't belong to Jane. This was important because the file seemed to automatically regenerate to back up files and directories within the directory. To verify this, I used the <b>rm</b> command to delete the tar file. After a short period, the tar file reappeared, confirming its vulnerability to a wildcard attack.<br />
