# Backup Privilege Escalation Testing

<h2> Lab </h2>

In this lab, I acted as a penetration tester tasked with identifying vulnerabilities in a target system's backup procedures. Key activities included:<br/>

-  <b>Privilege Escalation Testing</b>: Used the wildpwn.py tool to verify whether the system was vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks within its backup configuration.<br/>
-  <b>Vulnerability Assessment</b>: Analyzed the systemâ€™s current configuration to identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for unauthorized access or control.<br/>
